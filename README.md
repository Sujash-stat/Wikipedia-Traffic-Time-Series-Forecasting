# Wikipedia traffic time series forecasting

This project forecasted daily web traffic for 145,000 Wikipedia articles over two years, analyzing trends and seasonality while removing anomalies with Isolation Forest and imputing missing values. Stationarity was checked using the ADF test, and models like ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing were implemented. Exponential Smoothing achieved the best performance with an RMSE of 2.27.
